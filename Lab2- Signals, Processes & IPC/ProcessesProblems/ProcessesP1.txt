Based on this code:

/* Example of use of fork system call */
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  int pid;  
  pid = fork();
  if (pid < 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Fork failed!\n");
      exit(-1);
  }
  else if (pid==0) {
      execlp("/bin/ps", "ps", NULL);
      printf("Still around...\n");
  }
  else {
      exit(0);
  }
}

1. Modify the program so the parent process waits for the child process to end before exiting.
2. Modify the program so the child process displays its own process id and the process id of its parent
3. Modify the program so the parent process displays the process id of its child.
