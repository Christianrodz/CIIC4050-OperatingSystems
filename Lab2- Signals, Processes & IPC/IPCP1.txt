In this exercise, you will make use of all the basic knowledge we have been covering in previous parts: signals, processes and inter-process communication.

Please, peruse the following diagram and get familiar with the actors present and their relationships before you proceed.  

Complete client-server example diagram

Each box represents a separate process.  
The main process first forks the server process.  It then waits until it receives the SIGUSR1 signal, before forking the clients.  The server process sends this signal when it is ready to accept connections.  
Each client process shares one forked (via connect/accept/fork) socket with a paired child server process.  Each client sends one of its messages to the child server and waits for a response.  When the response arrives, it outputs its contents to standard output, along with its identity.  It then proceeds to send the next message, if any, until all its messages have been sent.  Client processes exit after sending all their messages.  
Child servers wait for messages to arrive from their paired client processes after connection.  When a message arrives, they output its contents to standard output along with their identity.  Then, they send the of the message back to the client process.  Child server processes exit after a prescribed amount of total idle time (about ten seconds).
The server will shutdown (exit) when it receives the SIGINT signal (sent by the main process).  
Finally, the zombie problem is avoided by having the server process wait for all its children to exit, before it exits.
Notes:
Message flow of each client-server(child) pair is decoupled from that of other pairs.  
Any number of clients (as server resources allow) can connect and exchange messages concurrently.
Sometimes the clients sleep between messages (about one second or so).  That makes it easier for the concurrency of the communication to show in the trace without sending many more messages. 
Server child processes will spend some time waiting between message receives.  They must do so without taking too much valuable CPU time from other processes.  
The following is a verbose trace of what might happen with two clients, named "Uno" and "Dos", sending three messages each to its paired child server.  Messages in this run (only for this example trace) have the format "Message <child number>-<message number>".  Process IDs are included inside parenthesis when appropriate.

Your job is to implement the code for the server (including children) and client processes.  You need to define the following functions, along with any supporting code:

void client(char *clientName, int numMessages, char *messages[]);
clientName is a properly terminated string with the name of the client.

numMessages is the number of messages to extract from messages.

messages is an array of properly terminated strings, each with a message to be sent.

This function is called within the body of the forked client process. It connects to the server (at address localhost:PORT_NUMBER) and sends each of the numMessages messages, as prescribed above. Instead of the verbose traces as shown above, this function must output the following lines for each message:

<name of client> : <client PID> : <message returned>

void server();

This function is called within the body of the forked server process. It binds to PORT_NUMBER (at locahost) and accepts client connections, as prescribed above. 

Instead of the verbose traces as shown above, this function must output the following lines for each message:

Server : <child server PID> : <message received>

This function must send the SIGUSR1 signal to the parent process when it is ready to accept connections.

This function must handle signal SIGINT to stop accepting connections and perform cleanup as prescribed above.

Any debugging output must be sent to the standard error (stderr).  Only properly formatted output should be sent to the standard output (stdout).  The automatic grader only looks at the standard output, and might get confused with unexpected output.

The following is an example output (over stdout) corresponding to the trace above:
Server : 7918 : Mensaje 1-1
Uno : 7916 : Mensaje 1-1
Server : 7919 : Mensaje 2-1
Dos : 7917 : Mensaje 2-1
Server : 7918 : Mensaje 1-2
Server : 7919 : Mensaje 2-2
Uno : 7916 : Mensaje 1-2
Dos : 7917 : Mensaje 2-2
Server : 7918 : Mensaje 1-3
Server : 7919 : Mensaje 2-3
Uno : 7916 : Mensaje 1-3
Dos : 7917 : Mensaje 2-3

Although your output might be a little different, it must have the following characteristics:
Messages sent/received by different clients will alternate in the order of the lines
All messages from all clients must be sent and received completely
Hints:
Clients must connect to the same port to which the server is bound.  To avoid collisions with ports used by other students during test case runs, please, choose a port number with the following format:
[1-4]<last 4 digits of your student number>
For example, if your student number ends in 1234, we suggest you choose as port number one of the following: 11234, 21234, 31234 or 41234.
Your processes should call fflush(stdout) after calling fprintf(stdout, ...) so that each line is printed as soon as possible.  
You might find it easier to progress incrementally to the desired solution, rather than trying to implement all requirements at once.  Analyze the trace and diagram provided above to understand what need to be done and design the solution one piece at a time, testing each increment separately.
Start by copying the code from the answer box to your favorite IDE editor.  Then, modify it until you have a working solution.  Only try to submit when you think you have a valid solution.  If you must submit an incomplete solution, you might do that as well, but you will need to wait for it to be graded by hand in order to see any partial points.
