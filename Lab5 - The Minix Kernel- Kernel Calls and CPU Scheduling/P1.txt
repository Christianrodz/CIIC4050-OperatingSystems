According to the instructions (Guide Lottery Scheduling) of this lab, enter below your modification of the descending enqueue algorithm.

Example

if this function is invoked with the following order of values of rp-> tickets:

rp-> tickets=6

rp-> tickets=5

rp-> tickets=8

rp-> tickets=7

rp-> tickets=9

After aplying your algorithm, the rdy queue should be in descending order as follow:

rdy_head->tickets=9

(rdy_head->p_nextready)->tickets=8

((rdy_head->p_nextready)->p_nextready)->tickets=7

((rdy_head->p_nextready)->p_nextready)->p_nextready)->tickets=6
